- HIHIHI!! Welcome to my GitHub!

- First of all - I LOVE YOU ALL THANKS FOR CHECKIN' THIS OUT !!

- I love my friends soooo much okay? okay.

- I kinda suck at interacting sooooo...

- if you see a cursed vox with a soulvester, that's probably me.

- Guys im actually really nice !!

- I'm pretty lonely ngl....

- Guys i'd probably be the mute one of a friend group on pony town so... my bad!

- STOP SENDING ME ART ON MY ATA THAT SAYS 'GAY' !

- Okay, I gotta admit that I love too many fandoms without knowin' that much about them. The only ones I really know much about are Hazbin Hotel, Helluva Boss, and Dandy's World. If you wanna get me into a new fandom, sign my ata!

- DO NOT COPY MY SKINS + FRIENDS SKINS!!

- We all love each other, right? Yeah!

- If I hurt you before, just hate me for it, okay? I'm horrible at doing the opposite anyways.

- If we also had any.. romantic situations, I probably fell out of it because of personal issues.

- I drink too much.

- I'm very awkward so sorry if I say stupid things.

- INTWEC: Have/had beef with me or my friends!

- DNI: Ship minors, under 10, gore, r34, ya'know! The usual.

- INT: If you are the opposite of the DNI!

- You can trust me with your friendships... Not sure about romance though!

- Guys, as always, I. AM. NOT. PANSEXUAL!! My Straw Page proves it!!

- This is getting too long! Sorry 'bout that!

- Do not be afraid to whisper or interact! I won't get mad at all!!
